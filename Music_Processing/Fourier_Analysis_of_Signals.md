# Fourier Analysis of Signals

### How does sound get in and out of the computer?

### Analog to digital conversion (ADC)

- Analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) is the process of converting an analog signal. which is a continuous waveform, into a digital signal, which consists of discrete numerical values. This is a fundamental process in digital electronics and signal processing, as it allows analog signals, such as sound, light, temperature, or other physical phenomena, to be converted into a form that can be processed by digital systems, like computers or digital audio equipment.
   - 模拟到数字转换 (Analog-to-digital conversion, ADC) 是将模拟信号（即连续的波形）转换为数字信号（由离散的数值组成）的过程。

- The Sampling Theorem
   - The Core Idea of the Sampling Theorem:
      - The theorem states that:
         - A continuous-time signal that is band-limited (i.e., its Fourier transform is zero above a certain frequency) can be completely reconstructed from its samples if it is sampled at a rate greater than twice the highest frequency component present in the signal.
         - This minimum rate is known as the Nyquist rate.
