### Week 1

##### Machine Learning
- "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." (Arthur Samuel, 1959)
    - In general, the more opportunities you give a learning algorithm to learn, the better it will perform. 

#### Machine Learning Algorithms
- Supervised Learning $\gets$ has been used most in real world applications and seen the most rapid advancements and innovation.
- Unsupervised Learning
- Recommender Systems
- Reinforcement Learning

$\gets$ Practical advice for applyting learning algorithms (tools and skills to apply them effectively)
