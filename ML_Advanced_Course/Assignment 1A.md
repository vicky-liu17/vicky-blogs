## 1.1 Exponential Family

A number of common distributions can be rewritten as exponential-family distributions with natural parameters, in the following form:

$$p(x|\theta) = h(x)exp(\eta(\theta)\cdot T(x) - A(\eta))$$

Below we provide five different distributions from exponential-family. Show which common distributions they correspond to.

#### Question 1.1.1:

- $\theta = \lambda$
- $\eta(\theta)=log(\theta)$
- $h(x)=\frac{1}{x!}$
- $T(x)=x$
- $A(\eta)=e^{\eta}$
