# Black-Box Variational Inference

- Why we care about probablistic programming?
- We have complicated data and we want to make sense of it.


- What is complicate data?
    - many data points, many dimensions.
    - unstructured (e.g. text)(not a matrix)
    - multi-modal（多峰的，多模式的） and interconeected(e.g. images, links, text, clicks)


- Make sense of data?
    - Make predictions about the future
    - Identify interpretable patterns
    - Do science: confirm, elaborate, form causal theories


Probablistic Machine Learning
- ML methods that connect domain knowledge(学科知识) to data
- Provides a computational methodology for scalable modelling
