# Probablity Space ( $\Omega$ , $\mathbb{A}$ , $\mathbb{P}$ )

- Sampe Space $\Omega$ : Random experiment cannot predict the outcome with certainty, e.g. coin toss , Yet we know all the possible outcomes
- The set of all possible outcomes is denoted by $\Omega$ and called **sample space** (or state space)

- An event E is said to occur on a particular trial of the experiment if the outcome observed is an element of the set E.

- Construct a sample space for the experiment that consists of tossing a single coin. The outcomes could be labeled  $h$ for heads and  $t$ for tails. Then the sample space is the set: $\Omega ={h,t}$

- Toss a coin twice $\Omega ={hh, ht, th, tt}$

- Toss a die $\Omega ={1,2,3,4,5,6}$

- Toss a die $n$ times:
    - When you toss a die $n$ times, each outcome can be represented as an ordered $n$ -tuple where each element is a number between 1 and 6 (since a die has 6 faces). The sample space is then the set of all possible such $n$ -tuples.

$$\Omega = \{(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \mid x_i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \text{ for } i = 1, 2, \dots, n\}$$

***

- **Empty Set ( $\emptyset )**: Represents an event with no possible outcomes. $(\emptyset) = 0$.
- **Union ( $A \cup B$ )**: Represents an event where either $A$, $B$, or both Poccur. $P(A \cup B)$ accounts for all outcomes in either event, correcting for overlap.
- **Intersection ( $A \cap B$ )**: Represents an event where both $A$ and $B$ occur simultaneously. $P(A \cap B)$ depends on whether the events are independent or dependent.
