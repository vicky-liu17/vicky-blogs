# Probablity Space ( $\Omega$ , $\mathbb{A}$ , $\mathbb{P}$ )

- Sampe Space $\Omega$ : Random experiment cannot predict the outcome with certainty, e.g. coin toss , Yet we know all the possible outcomes
- The set of all possible outcomes is denoted by $\Omega$ and called **sample space** (or state space)
