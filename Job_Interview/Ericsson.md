#### Tell me about yourself.
- Thank you very much for the opportunity to be interviewed today for this summer internship position with your company. My name is Yujie Liu. I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of Hong Kong, and I am currently pursuing a master's program in machine learning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Additionally, I have over one year of experience working as a software engineer at Alibaba Group, responsible for developing the Fliggy app, an app designed for tourists.
- I believe I am a quick learner and a skilled programmer, and I have a strong passion for computer and artificial intelligence technology. I have participated in relevant research and projects during my undergraduate and postgraduate studies, and won prizes in different hackathons. And I think I am also a good team worker who can fit into the team very quickly. When I worked in Alibaba Group, due to covid-19, the tourism industry is in a downturn, and there is a shortage of manpower in the department. I was primarily involved in Android development. However, due to the needs of the department, I quickly learned iOS, Flutter, and DynamicX. 
- While on the job, I encountered fascinating technologies like intelligent recommendation systems, AI customer service, and AR fitting rooms. These experiences fueled my passion for AI, and I decided to pursue a master's degree to deepen my knowledge in this area and enhance my career prospects.

#### Why do you want to apply for this internship?
- I'm really excited about the opportunity to join Ericsson because of its strong focus on innovation and research and development. The prospect of being part of a team driving cutting-edge technologies forward is highly appealing to me. Specifically, I'm fascinated by Ericsson's work in delivering Telecom AI, where they're integrating artificial intelligence into various aspects of telecommunications networks and operations. With my background in software development and AI, I'm confident that I can bring valuable insights and contribute meaningfully to this initiative. Plus, I see this internship as a fantastic opportunity to further develop my skills, learn about new technologies, and gain practical experience in this rapidly evolving field. Ericsson's commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive culture is also something I deeply value and want to be a part of. I can collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds and learn a lot of things from them. 

#### Why do you have a gap on your resume?
- After I leave my job at Alibaba, I spent a year applying for the master program at different universites, writing the application essays. I also need some time to prepare for my TOEFL and GRE exam. Besides, because I graduated from my undergraduate program a while ago, some basic theoretical knowledge that is not used in my work has become fuzzy in my memory. Therefore, during this period, I have been reviewing knowledge in areas such as linear algebra and probability theory to prevent myself from falling behind during my master's program.

#### Walk us through your resume.

#### Why are you the best person for the job?
- quick learner. Computer technology and AI is a rapidly evolving field, we need to learn a lot of things during working. 
- Work experience. Working in company is different from school projects. We cannot write code freely. We need to fulfill business needs, as well as cooperate with other people. I think I am good at this. In the past, when I worked on frontend development, I frequently collaborated with the product manager to discuss tasks, request APIs from the backend team, engaged with designers to discuss UI, write clear and commented code so that colleagues can understand it. And I can always finished work on time. 
- I also have the experience to deal with emergencies. For example, after the new version was launched, we quickly addressed the issue of crashes caused by a high volume of user traffic in a short time.
- I also cultivate the habit of writing documents and technical blogs. When I solved some bugs or learn some new knowledge, I always write it in the online notebook of my team. Our team can learn from each other's experiences.
- Problem server, love to doing research to get a solution to the problem: Besides, my department also has a rich research atmosphere. Every colleague has the habit of exploring technology outside daily work, such as VR live broadcasting and wearable devices. Motivated by them, I also delved into studying some performance optimization problems. For example, I found some pages of the Fliggy Android App rendering slowly and stuttering sometimes, and I was curious about what led to this problem. After research, I figured out that it was caused by overdraw. As the codes were getting more and more complex and the development cycle was growing shorter -- new versions of the Fliggy App were often released every one or two weeks, programmers mainly focused on business needs and rarely had time to deal with performance problems. I searched for similar cases on the internet and solved these problems by removing unneeded backgrounds and flattening the view hierarchy, making these app pages able to run smoothly. 
-  I also participated in converting some features of the iOS and Android apps to Flutter, a cross-platform software development kit. As Flutter enables one code base for all platforms and fast testing with hot reload, once it was implemented, the human resources required for developing new features would be reduced by about 50%. During this process, the biggest difficulty I encountered was building the underlying framework of the Fliggy Map, which required me to integrate the Amap API, the dart code, and the native Objective-C code together. Since the Fliggy Map has some specific decorations and functions that can only be realized through native codes at present, I needed to bridge between Dart and Native Code with Flutter Channel. Meanwhile, as the department just started to apply Flutter and lacked relevant guidance documents, I had to learn it by collecting wide-ranging information on the Internet and being the first one to try various possible methods. After continuous attempting and debugging, the code I wrote passed multiple rounds of testing and was put to use by about 1.5 million people, which gave me a strong sense of accomplishment. 

- Explainable/trust AI


#### Which are the best courses you have taken in school? 
- Software Engineering: I took in Nanyang Technological Univerisity in Singapore. In this course, I need to build an Software from scratch with my teammate. With the help of the teacher, we built an Android app named Health Advisor. It can help people design personal recipes and fitness plan as well as queryreal-time information about PM2.5, PSI, UVI, Pharmacies and Medicine. In addition to  deliver its functions, I made great effort  to Improve the user interface, make it look beautiful and convenient for people to use. Although it is just a simple app, it gave me sense of accomplishment. It is also the key to help me get the internship position at Alibaba. 

- **Artificial Intelligence:** actually, I took 2 courses about Artificial Intelligence. The first is in the Nanyang Technological Univerisity in Singapore, talk about the basic concept in AI, including intelligent agents, search etc. We would also develop some simple game and chat bots using prolog. The thing that impressed me most is the game theory, as the professor is an expert in this area. I find that many social phenomenon can be described by a model of game theory（workers take strike action）. My first research experience is guided by him. 
    - "Nash equilibrium" refers to a concept in game theory where each player's strategy is optimal given the strategies of other players, and no player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy. 
    - Stackelberg model:  It describes a situation where one player (the leader) makes decisions first, and then the other player (the follower) responds to those decisions. This contrasts with the Nash equilibrium, where all players make decisions simultaneously. In the Stackelberg model, the leader can take advantage of their position to influence outcomes, while the follower's choices are influenced by the leader's decisions.
    - In this scenario, the police department (referred to as the defender) allocates resources based on the traffic situation to catch drunk drivers and drivers under the influence (called attackers), whether they're driving drunk or using a designated driver service. The goal is to minimize their costs for travel routes. However, since resources are limited, our aim is to figure out the best way for the police to allocate their resources.
    - Learn to read papers: Optimal inspection problem (OIP) is such one that how to make sufficient use of limited security resources to inspect various illegal (or danger) actions or attackers,protect public properties and maximize the utilities of inspectors (i.e., defenders). 
        - For example, Pita et al. developed an Assistant for Randomized Monitoring over Routes (ARMOR) system to optimize the setting of checkpoints and the patrol scheduling of police dogs. 
        - Yin et al. presented a Tactical Randomization for Urban Security in Transit System(TRUSTS) to schedule randomized patrols for fare inspection in transit system. 
        - Matthew et al. proposed STrategic Randomization with Exploration and Exploitation in Traffic patrol Schedules (STREETS) for traffic patrolling to prevent mitigate accidents. 
    - In this scenario, we depict a zero-sum game where the defender's utility gain is balanced by the attacker's utility loss. Here's a summary of the utility matrix:(B denotes the big punishment cost of drunk driving, H denotes the fee of designated driving services)
        - (Drunk driving, Inspected): The attacker is fined B for drunk driving and being caught by the defender, resulting in a utility pair of (-B, B).
        - (Drunk driving, Uninspected): The attacker escapes penalty due to the defender's lack of inspection, yielding no payoffs for either party (0, 0).
        - (Not drunk driving, Inspected): The attacker opts for designated driving, incurring a cost H to avoid being fined B by the defender, resulting in a utility of B - H for the attacker. The defender, although not receiving the fine B, gains a reward R for ensuring traffic safety, leading to a utility of -B + R. Assuming R equals H for simplicity, the utility pair is (B - H, H - B).
        - (Not drunk driving, Uninspected): The attacker spends H while the defender doesn't inspect, similar to the previous case. The defender still receives a reward R, equal to H, for maintaining traffic safety. Thus, the utility pair is (-H, H).
    - Limited security resources are optimally allocated and relocated over time to efficiently inspect a traffic network, maximizing defender profits and minimizing travel time, leading to a comprehensive schedule for inspecting drunk driving.
    - we can abstract the traffic network into a directed graph. vertices V and a set of directed edges E , which can be looked as intersections and roads. Any two different vertices in the graph, which can be looked as the origin and destination of a route. (rational actors: find the path with lowest cost) 
    - In some cases, people passing by may notice an inspection happening and leak the information to drunk drivers, prompting them to change their routes to avoid detection, which reduces the effectiveness of the inspection and may require resource relocation. Typically, when a road is inspected, its corresponding edge in a graph can be removed to create a subgraph. Attackers will then select new shortest paths within this subgraph.
    - The approach for inspecting drunk driving includes two steps: first, figuring out the best way to allocate resources to maximize the defender's profits using Stackelberg equilibrium, and then fine-tuning resource relocation to balance inspection efforts and travel time.
    - I grasped the skills of literature reading, critical analysis, and academic writing. I searched and read many recent papers about the application of game theory to real life, extracted key information from them, and analyze their strengths, feasibility, and limitations, which gave me inspiration and helped me find my own idea. I realized that doing research is not the same as taking lessons. It does not have a standard answer， and it requires me to constantly explore different methods and possibilities. Meanwhile, as a first-time undergrad researcher, due to a lack of specialized knowledge and experience, I encountered many difficulties while reading literature and designing experimental methods. Thus, I frequently asked the professor and Ph.D. students in the same lab questions and learned from their experience. Because of the time limitation and insufficiency of relevant knowledge, this research was not completed. Nevertheless, I acquired information analysis and problem-solving abilities from it, which benefited me a lot in studying and working after that. 

- **KTH Artificial Intelligence:**
    - Compare with the undergraduate course in Singapore, this course in KTH offers both theoretical insights and hands-on practice, giving me a comprehensive understanding of how algorithms work in real-world scenarios. For instance, one project involves creating a fishing derby, where an AI agent utilizes alpha-beta pruning search to catch more fish, score higher points, and outperform opponents. We need to design a utility function to assist the agent in making decisions for its next actions.
    - In addition, to achieve a higher score, it's not just about mastering the knowledge from class, but also about making improvements to the algorithms. So, in order to attain a higher grade, I incorporated Principal Variation Search and adjusted the search window size to enhance efficiency. PVS focuses on searching the most promising lines of play first, based on the results of previous searches. This approach allows for more efficient search and deeper exploration of the game tree, potentially leading to improved performance in game-playing tasks.

- **Foundation of machine learning:**
    - use python numpy, scikit-learn to address problems. sometimes integrate pytorch. 
    - Linear Regression
    - Support Vector Machine,SVM
        -  It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes of data while maximizing the margin between them. The key concept involves identifying support vectors, which are the data points closest to the hyperplane.
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
        - In classification tasks, given an unlabeled sample, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm finds the K nearest training samples and determines the sample's class based on a majority vote among their labels. In regression tasks, the KNN algorithm finds the K nearest training samples and calculates their average or weighted average to predict the numerical value of the new sample.
    - Logistic Regression(classification)
    - Decision Tree
        - The construction of a decision tree involves recursively partitioning the dataset into subsets such that each subset contains data points that belong to the same class (or have similar regression values) as much as possible.
    - K-Means
        - K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into K distinct groups based on similarity. The algorithm works by iteratively assigning each data point to the nearest centroid and then recalculating the centroids based on the mean of the data points assigned to each cluster. This process continues until the centroids no longer change significantly or a specified number of iterations is reached.
    - Naive Bayes
    - gradient descent 
        - Gradient descent is an optimization technique commonly used in machine learning to minimize the error or loss of a model. It works by repeatedly adjusting the parameters of the model in the direction that reduces the error the most, eventually reaching the point of lowest error. This is done by calculating the gradient of the error function with respect to each parameter and updating the parameters in small steps based on this gradient. The process continues until the error converges to its minimum value.
    - dimensional reduction:
        - Dimensional Reduction, also known as dimensionality reduction, refers to the process of mapping high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, aiming to better understand the data, visualize it, reduce computational burden, and improve model generalization. By reducing dimensions, essential features of the dataset can be retained while minimizing noise and redundant information, thereby enhancing data processing efficiency and model performance. Common techniques for dimensional reduction include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),  among others.
    - Kernel functions:
        - By mapping data points to a higher-dimensional feature space, where it might be easier to classify the data, kernel functions help SVMs find non-linear decision boundaries.
        - Common kernel functions include linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid kernels, each suited for different types of data and tasks. They are chosen based on the specific problem and the structure of the data.

### Final Year Project
    - An AI Piano Tutor App
        - for beginners, it is hard for them to evaluate their performance during the self-practice time, as they have no idea whether their pace, tones or notes are correct.
        - This project is focused on developing a new method for piano learners to evaluate their performance. The idea is to create a program that records a student playing a music piece, compares it with samples from music masters or teachers, and provides feedback on factors like accuracy of notes, dynamics, tempo, and more. By utilizing Python's librosa library and Dynamic Time Warping algorithm, the program can analyze the similarity between the student's recording and the sample piece, ultimately calculating a score to assess the student's performance based on this similarity.
        - Limitation(current apps)
            - Piano Tutor: The main function of the app is staff recognition exercises, rather than practicing piano music. Additionally, it only allows users to play through the keys on the app interface and does not recognize recordings of music played on a real piano.
            - Piano Tutoring Class: Have to access the midi keyboard to recognise music
            - Most apps primarily assist users with staff reading, fingering exercises, and music theory, such as Piano Tutor and Stave Master. However, they rarely provide opportunities for users to practice playing full music pieces. Some apps offer tutorials, like Flowkey, but lack feedback mechanisms. Few apps can provide feedback, but they often have strict device requirements, like Piano Tutoring Class, where users must use a MIDI keyboard or the virtual keyboard on the interface, which can be inconvenient.
        - Librosa is a Python package deal for audio and music analysis. It offers the construction blocks essential to develop MIR programs
            - extract onset, beats
            - Spectral feature: note accuracy. The energy distributions over a series of frequencies. we get the chroma vector from the audio recording, we could display the spectrogram. 
            - I utilized the Constant-Q Transform (CQT) to analyze the note accuracy of the music piece because it is better suited for music signals compared to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The perception of sound frequency by the human ear is non-linear; certain frequency bands are more sensitive than others. This sensitivity follows a logarithmic distribution, meaning that as frequency increases, sensitivity decreases. CQT addresses this by performing logarithmic compression, resulting in analysis closer to the perception of human ears compared to FFT.
            - The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm is a technique used to find the optimal alignment between two time series. It can handle differences in the lengths or progression speeds of the sequences and allows for nonlinear stretching or compressing of the time axis to find the best match. DTW is commonly used in fields such as speech recognition and music analysis, where it accurately measures the similarity between sequences with different rhythms or speeds. It is a powerful tool in tasks related to pattern recognition and signal processing.
            - Because the notes in a piano piece are not continuous, and the analysis result can be affected by noise, it's necessary to preprocess the audio signal before calculating similarity.
            - The second student is a beginner, he is very unskilled in playing the piano. His playing speed is slower than the requirements of the music piece and sometimes plays wrong notes. But at least, when others heard his recording, they were still able to recognize the corresponding track. 4.33
            - The third piano player is more skilled, but the version she played is slightly different from the recording. In her version, the accompaniment part was played harder than in the original version. But beyond this, she played fluently and made few mistakes. 8.67
            - When the user's playing speed significantly differs from the sample, it can become challenging to accurately assess the user's strength and note accuracy. This implies that users are expected to have a certain level of proficiency in the corresponding piano piece when using this program.
            - When assessing the accuracy of the notes, we can only obtain approximate pitch classes. However, piano playing involves much more complexity. For instance, accurately identifying chords from recordings can be challenging. Therefore, in future work, chord recognition will be a major focus.

    
### Weakness:
    - I tend to get caught up in the little details, which can distract me from the ultimate goal. When I was a junior web designer at Harold’s Hats, I was asked to revamp our size guide and make it more fun and visually interesting. Unfortunately, I became so fixated on finding the perfect font that I missed the deadline. These days, I break each project down into mini-tasks, each with their own deadline. If I spend too long on an individual thing, I set it aside and move on to the next one. Usually, by the time I come back to the imperfect piece, I can be more objective about whether or not it needs more work.
    - e.g. focus on the performance, sometimes it lauching slow.A few pixels doesn't appear correcly. 


### Workstyle:
-  tend to do my best work when I’m collaborating with colleagues and we’re working together toward a common goal. I was that  student who loved group projects. sense of accomplishment finish a big project form scratch and overcome difficulties with groupmates. undergraduate, hachathon, organize after-school activities

### Motivate
- “I stay motivated by thinking about the end result. I’ve found that even in the midst of a challenging situation, reminding myself of my goals helps me take a step back and stay positive.”
- When faced with a situation of being stuck and
 doing repetitive work, I will use several strategies to motivate myself and ensure completion:
Firstly, If things get boring, I switch up my approach or find a way to make it more interesting. Sometimes taking a short break, going for a walk, or doing something unrelated for a bit helps me can make me more energetic. Secondly, I also like to remind myself why I'm doing the task in the first place. Understanding the bigger picture helps me see the purpose and keeps me motivated. I may also set up a little reward system. Like, every time I hit a mini-milestone, I treat myself to a quick break, a snack, etc. 
Finally, sometimes I will reach out for help.Friends, colleagues, and teachers often inspire me and help me break free from difficulties that make me stuck. 

### Hobbies
- go to the gym and running or swimming
- 5 kilometers each day recently. 
- releasing endorphin which will improve your mood


### Tell me about a time when you successfully conveyed your ideas to an individual or group so that they were able to understand and retain the message?

In 2019, I participated in the Global Legal Hackathon and developed a website called Access Our Community, which can intelligently and effectively match the lawyers and the Non-Governmental Organizations in need. Our team stood out from about 6000 individuals across 26 countries and was invited to compete in New York City as ‘Global Finalists’. 
Explaining the complex features of this website in a simple and clear way to the judges is quite challenging.
This website has three different types of users: lawyers, non-governmental organizations, and pro-bono coordinators. Each type of user encounters different scenarios and performs different operations.
So, in the presentation, we created a lively video featuring three characters, Lucy, Penny, and Justin. We told a story about them who use the website to solve real-world problems. As a result, the judges quickly understood the functions and purposes of different pages on the website.

### Tell me about a time when you received negative feedback. How did you react to the feedback, and did you make improvements?

During my exchange program in Singapore, I participated in a research project on game theory. As it was my first research experience, I encountered some difficulties, such as struggling to understand academic papers, extracting key points, and finding my own research direction. The professor had high expectations, and he often felt that my weekly progress did not meet the anticipated level.

Receiving this feedback left me feeling discouraged, and at times, I even doubted my abilities, uncertain if I could complete the research project. However, through discussions with friends and online forums, I gradually realized that facing challenges and difficulties is a common experience for everyone during their first research endeavors. The key is to seek help actively.

Due to the professor's frequent busyness, it was challenging for me to consult with him regularly. Therefore, I turned to the doctoral students in the lab for guidance, asking them about methods for reading literature and extracting key points. Additionally, I proactively strengthened my foundational knowledge by learning probability theory, which was not covered in some of my school courses.

Through this experience, my independent research skills saw significant improvement. During challenging times, I am deeply grateful for the help and encouragement provided by the professor and doctoral students.

### Tell us about some skills that you have learned or improved in the past 6 months?

In the past six months, my understanding of machine learning algorithms has significantly improved. Previously, I primarily worked in software development, with a limited understanding of artificial intelligence algorithms.

However, upon entering KTH, I enrolled in courses such as "Artificial Intelligent" and "Foundation of Machine Learning," where I learned about topics including search algorithms, Hidden Markov Models, dimensionality reduction, neural networks, and related programming. In addition to on-campus courses, I also took Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning" course on Coursera, completing numerous programming exercises.

Meanwhile, While doing group projects with classmates, my spoken English proficiency and teamwork skills have experienced significant enhancement.I've learned how to better manage my time, and I learned more effective communication methods.

### Baum Welch
- The Baum-Welch algorithm, also known as the forward-backward algorithm, is an iterative procedure used to estimate the parameters of a hidden Markov model (HMM). It is employed in unsupervised learning scenarios where the underlying structure of the model is not fully known, and observations are available. The algorithm iterates between two main steps: the forward pass, which computes the probability of observing a sequence of symbols given the model, and the backward pass, which updates the model parameters based on the observed sequence. This iterative process continues until convergence, refining the model's parameters to better fit the observed data. The Baum-Welch algorithm is widely used in various fields, including speech recognition, bioinformatics, and natural language processing.
