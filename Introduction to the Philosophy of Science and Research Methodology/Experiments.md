## Experiments

##### Three Chatacteristic Features of Experiments

- Experimenting is an observation process characerised by:
    - Control of background variables through manipulation
    - Intervention on target variable through manipulation
    - Observation of difference produced by intervention

### What makes experiments special?

- Mill's Method of Difference
    1. We ask: what causes phenomenon E?
    2. We conjecture: C causes R (hypothesis)
    3. We produce two situations S1 and S2, in which neither C nor E occur and in which all causally relevant factors are the same. (successful control)
    4. We activate C in S1 but not in S2. (successful intervantion)
    5. We observe that E occurs in S1 but not in S2.(observation of differences)
    6. In S1, something causes E(from 5)
    7. In S2, nothing causes E(from 3)
    8. The only differences between S1 and S2 are C and E (from 3 and 4)

- **Conlusion: C causes E**

- In actual experiment, we might fail to control all causally relevant factors. (C might not be the only causal factor)
- We might fail to activate C in S1, or inadvertently activateit in S2. 
- We might be wrong in observing a difference between S1 and S2
- We assume that E is caused, it that it is part of a deterministic system, or that it doesn't cause itself. 

#### Summary

- Experiments are observational process
- Experiments are characterised by manipulation, intervention, control and observation
- Experimental observations often offer a justification for accepting or rejecting a hypothesis
- The argument from experimental observation to causal claims is fallible: it might contain errors
- In order to minimize these potential errors we need to design experiments carefully


## Experiments vs. Other Observational Practices

- Not all areas can conduct experiments; for example, in astronomy, we cannot manipulate the stars.
- observational studies are not experiments.

### Non-experimental Empirical Practices

- Observational studies:
    - no manipulation
    - no intervention on target varibale
    - no control of background variable

- Observational study: An observational process characterized by control of the background factors and observation of an outcome, lacking an intervention.

- Natural Experiments:
    - no manipulation
    - no intervention on target varibale
    - control of background variable (not achieved through manipulation)

- Natural experiment: An observational study where circumstances are organized as if there had been manipulation for intervention and control but no manipulation is in fact done.

#### Field Experiments
- Maintain the same found conditions in both treatment(also called the experimental group) and control group varying only the intervention on the factor of interest. 

- no manipulation
- no intervention on target variable
- control of background variable(not achieved through manipulation)

- Field experiment: An experiment where there is manipulation for intervention, but where several background variables are not controlled, in particular not controlled through manipulation.

#### Laboratory Experiments
- Construct the same background conditions in both treatment and control group(through manipulating the environment) varying only the intervention on the factor of interest. 

- Laboratory experiment: An experiment where there is manipulation for intervention and where all or most relevant variables are controlled.
