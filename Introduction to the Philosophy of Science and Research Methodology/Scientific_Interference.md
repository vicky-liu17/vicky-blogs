## Scientific Interference

- Particular experiment or observation is just a part of science. 
- Science is not generally interested in particular, but scientists wants to generalize. They want to say something that beyond the particular they observe. 
- Predict something they don't know yet. 

#### Inference:

> They act or process of reaching a conclusion about something from known facts or evidence. (Merriam-Webster)
