## Explanations and Causes

### Explanation as an Aim of Science

- Scientific Knowledge
    - Prediction
        - Forecasts
        - Reasons for expecting a phenomenon to occur in a paricular way
    - Design
        - Functioning artifacts
        - Reasons for expecting that a manipulation satisfies certain functions
    - Explanation
        - Understanding
        - Reasons for why the phenomenon to be explained is expected on a lawful basis

- In explanation the same as prediction, just applied to phenomena already observed. 

### The Deductive-Nomologival Account

- Natural law: A scientific law, usually thought to capture fundamental relationships in the natural world.

- Law-like generalization: A generalization based on empirical evidence which appears to capture regularities in a way similar to how a law does.

- Deductive-Nomological account of explanation: An account of what an explanation is that is based on deduction from natural laws or law-like generalizations, and initial conditions.

### Summary:
- Explanation as one aim of science
- Explanation provides understanding
- DN Account: Understanding a phenomenon achieved through deducing it from laws of nature

## Achieving Understanding

- Answer: B

- such what-if questions can be answered by tracing productive relationships 
- Explanations help us understand by identifying the productive relationships - i.e. the relevant causes

##### Cause: 
A change in one object or event which produces a change in another object or in another event.

- Causal account of explanation: An account of explanation where causes are the main component of the explanans (that which provides the explanation).
