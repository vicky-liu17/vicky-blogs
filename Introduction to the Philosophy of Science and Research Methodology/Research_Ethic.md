## Research Ethics

#### Moral Questions in Science
- May I perform experiments that might harm human subjects?
-  Must I reject data if I suspect it to be falsified?What do I do if I suspect that my colleague is either falsifying data himself or is using such falsified data?
- Who should be counted as an author of a scientific manuscript?
- What kind of research topics should I choose?

##### Moral Answers

- Permission
    - e.g. "You may perform this experiment"
- Obligation
    - e.g. "You should count your collaborator as a co-author."
- Prohibition
    - e.g. "You must not falsify data."

These forms do not fully characterize moral judgements. 

#### What is Morality?

- Descriptive View
    - A code of conduct that is put forward by a society, group, or individual, that is accepted as a guide to behaviour by its members, ot by that individual. 

- Normative view:
    - The code of conduct that all rational persons, under certain specified condtions, would endorse. 
- Distinguish Morality from:
    - Convention(e.g. You should drive at the right side of the road. )
    - Etiquett(礼节，规矩)
    - Law
    - (self-interested)instrumental rationality

- Examples of scientific codes of conduct:
    - Swedish Association of Graduate Engineers -  honor code for engineers
    - APS (American Physical Society) Guidelines for Professional Conduct

### Ethics vs. Morality

- Ethics:
    - A theory that offers normatively valid reasons for rationally endorsing a code of behaviour. 
- Research Ethics:
    - why should I endorse a certain code of behavior?
    - Why is it rational for all scientists to endorse certian codes of behavior?
    - Add to reasons for method choice.(pro and con for each method)
- Even if we agree on a code of conduct, we might not agree on why we agree on it. 


### Different Ethical Intuitions:
- To behave morally might mean:
    - Bring about the best consequences
    - Following relevant rules and duties
    - Exemplifying relevant character traits or virtues

### Three Ethic Frameworks

##### Part 1: consequentialism(效果论) and deontology(道义论)

- Consequentialism:
    - Choices are to be morally assesed only by their consequences. 
- Deontology:
    - To choose morally is to fulfill relevant rules and duties. 
- Virtue ethics:
    - Morality consists in having exemplifying good character traits.
