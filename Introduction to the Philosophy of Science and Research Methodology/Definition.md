## Definition

#### The need for definition

- Unlike meanings, definitions are artificial constuctions.
- Definitions can be useful for bringing to surface the question of what we mean by the words we are using. This is especially important when there are unclarities embedded into these words. 

### Different kinds of definitions

- Definitions consist of two parts - a term to be defined (a definiendum) and a description intended to represent the meaning of that term (a definiens). 
    - Definiendum: What is to be defined
    - Definiens: What provided the definition

> A bachelor (definiendum) is (i.e., is identical to) an unmarried, adult, male human being (definiens).

- Definitions come in two falvour: lexical definitions and stipulative definition.
    - Lexical definition: What is commonly meant by a word in a certain language or context.
        - attempts to represent meanings that are assumed to alredy exist
    - Stipulative definition: What a word is intended to mean in a certain language or context.
        - bring meanings into existence.

-  A lexical definition is a hypothesis about what the meaning of a given definiendum is, in a particular language or context ("what people usually mean"), while a stipulative definition is a constitutive declaration of a definiendum's meaning, in a particular language or context ("what I now intend the word to mean")

#### Accuracy

- Definitions: to what extent a lexical definition captures the common meaning.

- Wide: A lexical definition is too wide if its definiens applies to more things than it should.

- Narrow: A lexical definition is too narrow if there are things that its definiens does not apply to, shich is should. 

- Stipulative definitions cannot be more or less accurate, because accuracy can only be estimated in relation to target. Stipulative definitions do not have targets.

#### Vagueness and Ambiguity

- Purpose dependent: the quality of a stipulative definition is dependent on its purpose and is therefore purpose dependent.

- Precision(definitions): To what extent a stipulative definition provides clarity in its context. 

- Vague: a word is vague if there is no clear-cut distinction between where the word can be applied and where it cannot. 

- A lot of the time, the purpose of constructing a stipulative definition is to reduce vagueness.

- vagueness should be distinguished from ambiguity.
- The word space can refer to the distance between planets and stars as well as to the empty area in a room. Bridges, for example, can be found on violins, in songs and over rivers.
- These words are ambiguous. 

- Ambiguous: A word is ambiguous if there are two distinct meanings of the words, in the way they could be interpreted as two completely different words.
