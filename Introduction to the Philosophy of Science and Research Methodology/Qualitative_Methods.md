## Qualitive Methods

### Studying human behavior

- Design often requires studying human behavior

```mermaid
graph LR;
A["customer's need"]-->B[Functional Description]-->C[Physical Description]-->D[Artefact];
```

- What function should the device satisfy?
- Design Validation:
    - Does design fulfill client's, users; and customers' functional requirements, under specified operating conditions?

#### Social Science use different methods

Methodology Questions:
- How to assess these methods?
- How to justify choosing between them?


Social Science:
- Qualitative
- Interpretation
- Focus on specific

Natural Science:
- Quantitative
- Causal regularities
- nomological

Some claim that:
- Because social science are different ... Social science methodology must be different, too. 

We argues that:
- Although these methods are different from those used in the natural science, the reasons/quality critera for choosing between them are the seem. 

### Interpretation

Folk psychology
- Simulation theory
    -  We reuse our own cognitive mechanisms to simulate other people’s mental states
- Theory theory
    - We construct a theory of mind just like a scientific theory, using collecting evidence and revising hypotheses


#### Belief-Desire Explanation
- Individual i desired state X more than state Y
- Individual i believed that action A brought about X but not Y, and B Y but not X. 
- THerefore, individual i chose action A over action B. 

- **Belief-desire explanation**: An agent’s action A (instead of B) is explained by her desiring some result X (and not Y), and her believing that A will bring about X (andthat B will bring about Y).

##### What are mental states?

- Wilhelm Wundt(Intropective psychology):
    -  tried to systematize this notion of introspection by arguing that one could train one’s own conscious thoughts and feelings in such a way as to observe one’s mental states under controlled conditions. Wundt sat up a number of routines on how to perform this systematic and controlled experimental introspective psychology. 
- Methodological behaviourism:
    - psychology is really only in the business of observing public events. That is, motor behaviours of an individual. Only those can be objectively observed while thoughts and feelings, which may or may not exist, are not part of the science of behaviour, hence they should be put aside. So, what now becomes important is to develop regularities according to these methodological behaviourists, in order to discover and develop regularities between stimuli and responses. E.g. Pavlov and his dog
-  cognitive Science:
    - methodological behaviourism could not explain how humans can know so much even though they have relatively little input.
    - Chomsky in particular developed this argument based on the example of children learning languages. He argued that humans must have some kind of innate learning mechanism that processes inputs in a very effective way, and that these mechanisms must be domain specific and innate.
    - connect interptration and people's cognitive process. Not the same as Intropective psychology. 

#### Interpretation as Adopting the Intentional Stance

The intentional stance: Attributing mental states like beliefs and desires to an agent A (a human, an animal or even a machine),assuming A to be rational, and using this to predict the actions of A.
    - Decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent.
    - Figure out what belief & desires that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. 
    - Decide what the agent ought to do, given the attributed beliefs and desires.
