### Probability

##### Bernoulli and binomial distribution
- Suppose we have a binary random variable, $x \in$ {0,1}, which we can thingk of as representing the outcome of a coin toss. It is common to model such a variable using the Bernoulli distribution, which has the form

$$
P(X = x) =
\begin{cases}
    \mu & \text{if } x = 1 \\
    1 - \mu & \text{if } x = 0
\end{cases}
$$

where $\mu = \mathbb{E}= p(x=1)$ is the mean.

If x counts the number of heads in N trials, we can use the binomial distribution:

$$Bin(x|N,\mu) \stackrel{\Delta}{=} \binom{N}{x}\mu^x(1-\mu)^(N-x)$$

where $\binom{N}{k}\stackrel{\Delta}{=}\frac{N!}{(N-k)!k!}$ is the number of ways to choose k items from N(that is known as the binomial coefficient, and is pronounced "N choose k"). If N = 1, the binomial distribution reduces to Bernoulli distribution.

##### Categorical and multinomial distributions

- 将一个小球放入两个桶，记变量x为第一个桶里小球的个数，那么只有0个或1个，所以服从伯努利分布；
- 将n个小球放入两个桶，记变量x为第一个桶里小球的个数，那么最少可能有0个，最多可能有n个，所以服从二项分布；
- 将1个小球放入k个桶，记变量x为第k个桶里小球的个数，所以是一个向量，并且是one-hot形式，因为小球只能放在一个桶里面，所以是服从Categorical分布；
- 将n个小球放入k个桶，记变量x为第k个桶里小球的个数，是一个向量，并且向量元素的和为n，所以是服从多项分布。

- If the variable is discrete-valued, x $\in$ {1,...K}, we can use the categorical distribution:

$$Cat(x|\mathrm{\theta})\stackrel{\Delta}{=} \prod_{k=1}^{K}\theta_k^{\mathbb{I}(x=k)}$$

- theta is a vector
- $\theta_k$ represents the probability associated with category $k$. In the context of a categorical distribution, $\theta_k$ is the probability of the random variable $x$ being equal to category $k$.
- $\mathbb{I}(x=k)$ is an indicator function. It takes the value 1 if the condition $x=k$ is true and 0 otherwise. In this context, $\mathbb{I}(x=k)$ is used to check if the random variable $x$ is equal to category $k$.

- Alternatively, we can represent the K-valued variable x with the one hot binary vector **x**, which lets us write:

$$Cat(x|\mathrm{\theta})\stackrel{\Delta}{=} \prod_{k=1}^{K}\theta_k^{x_k}$$

- $x_k$ is the $k$-th element of the one-hot binary vector **x**. It is equal to 1 if category $k$ is the category represented by $x$, and it is 0 otherwise.

> A one-hot binary vector is a binary vector (a vector of binary values, typically 0s and 1s) where only one element is set to 1 (hot), and all other elements are set to 0 (cold). It is often used to represent categorical variables or labels in machine learning and data analysis. The "hot" element corresponds to the category or label that is being represented.

> e.g. Suppose you have a set of fruits: {Apple, Banana, Orange, Grape}. You can represent each of these fruits using a one-hot binary vector like this: 
    - Apple: [1, 0, 0, 0] (1 in the first position)
    - Banana: [0, 1, 0, 0] (1 in the second position)
    - Orange: [0, 0, 1, 0] (1 in the third position)
    - Grape: [0, 0, 0, 1] (1 in the fourth position)

- If the k'th element of **x** counts the number of time the value k is seen in $N=\sum_{k=1}^{K}x_k$ trials, then we get the **multinomial distribution** :

$$\mathcal{M}(x|N,\theta)\stackrel{\Delta}{=}\binom{N}{x_1....x_k}\prod_{k=1}^{K}\theta_k^{x_k}$$

- $\binom{N}{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_K}$ represents the multinomial coefficient, which calculates the number of ways to arrange $N$ trials into $x_1$ for category 1, $x_2$ for category 2, and so on, up to $x_K$ for category $K$. It accounts for the different ways these counts can be distributed within the $N$ trials.
- $\prod_{k=1}^{K} \theta_k^{x_k}$ is the product term that specifies the probability of observing category $k$ exactly $x_k$ times in each individual trial.
