### Probability

##### Bernoulli and binomial distribution
- Suppose we have a binary random variable, $x \in$ {0,1}, which we can thingk of as representing the outcome of a coin toss. It is common to model such a variable using the Bernoulli distribution, which has the form

$$
P(X = x) =
\begin{cases}
    \mu & \text{if } x = 1 \\
    1 - \mu & \text{if } x = 0
\end{cases}
$$
