# Introduction

### Information Retrieval(IR)

Finding relevant information
- in unstructured large sets of material (usually documents),
- satisfying an information need of the user.

### What IR is not
- An IR system is not a database system
- Databases
    - are structured
        - IR systems typically deal with unstructured or loosely structured data, such as text documents, web pages, or multimedia content. The focus is on understanding the meaning and context of the content.
        - Database systems handle structured data with predefined schemas, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data with well-defined relationships.
    - allow for exact search
        - IR systems often use relevance ranking algorithms to present search results in order of relevance to the user query. The goal is to provide the most relevant information, even if it doesn't exactly match the query.
        Database systems typically return exact matches to queries based on the structured data stored in the database.
- IR is inexact in several regards:
    - information need, search query, relevance
