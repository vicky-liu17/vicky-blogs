# Introduction


- Regression analysis is regarded as one of the oldest and most time-tested topics in mathematical statistics. The earliest form of the linear regression was the least squares method(最小二乘法).

- Nowadays, linear regression plays an important role, e.g., in machine learning. The linear regression algorithm is one of the fundamental supervised machine-learning algorithms due to its relative simplicity and completeness of theory.

- Multiple Linear Regression can be used as an activation function in a layer of (Deep) Artificial Neural Networks.


### Simple Linear Regression
- The theory and practice of regression deals with the following situation. There are n pairs of values(real numbers)

$$D_tr=[(x_1,y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)]$$
